Requirements for running MyMediaLite:
 - Mono 2.8.x or another recent .NET runtime (Mono 2.10.x recommended)
 - Perl and File::Slurp for the download and data processing scripts
   (not necessary for running/building MyMediaLite)

Instructions:
 - If you have the binary package, just copy its contents to wherever you
   want and run the programs from there.
   - On Unix systems: copy bin/ and lib/ e.g. to /usr/local or to ~,
     and make sure that bin/ is withing your PATH.
 - To build from source:
   - On Unix systems: run "make all", set the PREFIX varible in the Makefile,
                      then run "make install"
   - On Windows, compile using Visual Studio or MonoDevelop

Requirements for building MyMediaLite:
 - the above requirements plus
   - Doxygen 1.6.3 or later

Tested configurations:
 - Ubuntu 10.04
   - with manually installed Mono 2.10.5 and MonoDevelop 2.6/2.8.1
   - Doxygen 1.6.3
 - Ubuntu 11.10
   - with Mono 2.10.5
 - Ubuntu 14-04
   - with Mono 3.2.8 and and MonoDevelop 4.0.12
 - Debian Wheezy
   - with Mono 2.10.1 and MonoDevelop 2.8.2
